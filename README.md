# 🧠 3D + 2D Ray Caster (Python + Pygame)

This project is a simple yet powerful **3D + 2D ray caster** written in **Python** using **Pygame**. It visually demonstrates how ray casting works by rendering both a 3D first-person perspective and a 2D top-down map view.

## 🧩 Features

- 3D view using classic ray casting (like Wolfenstein 3D)
- 2D top-down view with rays drawn in real-time
- Smooth player movement and rotation
- Customizable map layout
- Lightweight and educational

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

## 🎮 Controls

- `W` / `A` / `S` / `D` – Move Forward / Left / Backward / Right  
- `←` / `→` – Rotate view
